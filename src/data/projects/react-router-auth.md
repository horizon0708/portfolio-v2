## About
This is a front-end application (with minimal back-end) that lets users sign-up and log-in.  Only logged in users can see super-secret-profile page. Pages are secured by using react-router and Passport.js to check for authentication before routing them to secure react components.

## Goals
- Learn how to create a react app with authentication. 

## Post Mortem
- I had ran into some problems because react-router had updated to v4.

## Future goals
- Learn about OAuth.
- Learn about more about web security.
