## About
This is a simple game written in an evening using C# and Unity. 
The aim of the game is simple: get the Jack of Diamonds from a shuffled deck of cards as in the least amount of draws as possible.
That's it. 

## Post Mortem
- It was amazing to see my app on my phone, working well. I would like to simplify some of my unpublished games into something simple and finished so that it can be published to the play store.
