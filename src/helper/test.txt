Using RethinkDB's unique changefeed feature, I built a secondary database for logging that logged numbers of users after every changes in the primary user DB.\n\nFront-end components are built with React-Redux, and are updated as soon as there is a change in the DB. The updates are pushed with socket.io and stored in a Redux store. C3.js is used to visualise data.\n\n## Goals\n- Learn real-time data-visualisation using C3.js, socket.io and RethinkDB.\n- Learn more about back-end development and deployment.\n- Familiarise myself more with Redux. \n\n## Post Mortem\n- I realised the importance of having a good development environment. Tooling was time-consuming and hard, and I have appreciated how amazing create-react-app was. I would like to be able to set up an automated back-end development environment.\n- Deploying can be a nightmare. 'Works on my machine' problem is very real. I still have one amazingly weird bug (ask me for more details!)\n- I've also appreciated how good ESLint is at keeping my code clean.\n\n## Future goals\n- Learn more about D3.js and websockets. While C3.js and Socket.io are amazing abstractions, I feel like I would be able to do much more if I understood web-sockets and d3.js.\n- Learn more about Docker. I would like future deployments to be less painful.\n\n\n\n\n\n","frontmatter":"name: 3ree-dashboard\ntitle: 3REE Dashboard\ntags: \n- Fullstack\n- FrontEnd\n- BackEnd\n- React\n- Redux\n- Express\n- Node.js\n- RethinkDB\n- Bootstrap\n- Socket.io\n- Webpack\n- C3.js\nlinks:\n    github: https://github.com/horizon0708/rethink-dashboard-back \n    link: https://rethink-dashboard.herokuapp.com/"},{"attributes":{"name":"jackie-d","title":"Jackie D","tags":["C#","Unity"],"links":{"link":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SurprisedCat.JackieD&hl=en"}},"body":"## About\nThis is a simple game written in an evening using C# and Unity. \nThe aim of the game is simple: get the Jack of Diamonds from a shuffled deck of cards as in the least amount of draws as possible.\nThat's it. \n\n## Post Mortem\n- It was amazing to see my app on my phone, working well.
